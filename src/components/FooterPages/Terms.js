            would fly for three to four hours. All dependent on location,
            severity of injury, weather, etc. Trekkers must all have Medical &
            Rescue Insurance before starting a trip with Mission Summit Treks.
            Our company would arrange the evacuation and rescue operation and
            the cost would be settled after arriving in Kathmandu. We can also
            gather all the necessary documents as support to submit to trekker’s
            insurance companies.

            The itineraries seen on the website, on our Facebook page, or given
            to you by our guides are meant as a rough idea, not as a contractual
            obligation. An itinerary can change dependent on a variety of
            factors, such as weather, transportation difficulties, political
            instability, injuries, and more. Our trekking guide will make all
            decisions and changes necessary for a smooth trip. Only rarely will
            such changes be significant and Mission Summit Treks will do
            everything in its power to minimize the effects of any enforced
            change. We cannot be held response.
