          When you start to think about it legal documents are everywhere.
          Sometimes you can find them in the small print at the bottom of an
          advert, or on a receipt for something that you purchased. Other times
          a legal document is something personal to you, like a will or a
          contract. This section explains situations where you might need a
          legal document and who you can contact to create it for you.
